# Data Hazards Self-Assessment Shiny App

This Shiny application provides an interactive way to explore and select
**data hazards** from the [Data Hazards Project](https://datahazards.com/).
Users can:

- Browse hazards presented as cards with icons and titles.
- Click a hazard card to open a modal with its description, examples, and safety precautions (pulled live from datahazards.com).
- Select hazards using checkboxes.
- Download a self-assessment template as a Markdown document that includes
  the selected hazards in a table, ready to be filled in with project-specific reasoning.
