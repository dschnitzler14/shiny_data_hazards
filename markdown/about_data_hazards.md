# About this Companion App

This companion app has been developed to make it even easier to create your hazards labels for your own projects.

Simply select the hazards you think your project contains from the list below. Once you have selected the hazards, you can add a short description to each icon. Finally, a pdf will be produced that you can download or send to yourself by email.

## Data Protection

Your data will not be saved in this app. Each session is isolated and cannot be accessed again once you close out. _This means that your work will also not be saved!_
