# About the Data Hazards Project

Data Hazards is a project to help us all identify the hazards of using data science.

# About this Companion App

This companion app has been developed to make it even easier to create your hazards labels for your own projects.

Simply select the hazards you think your project contains from the list below. Once you have selected the hazards, you can add a short description to each icon. Finally, a pdf will be produced that you can download or send to yourself by email.
